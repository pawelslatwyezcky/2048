3. Start a live server to make module js script type enabled.

## Online Game Page

You can open link: https://pawelslatwyezcky.github.io/2048/ and play on desktop/mobile.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to slide the tiles in the corresponding direction.
- Tiles with the same number will merge into one when they collide.
- After each move, a new tile with the value of 2 or 4 will appear on the grid.
- The game ends when you reach the 2048 tile or when there are no more valid moves available.
